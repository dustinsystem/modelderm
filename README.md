The algorithm (Model Dermatology) could diagnose 184 skin conditions. The performance of standalone algorithm was comparable with that of dermatologists in experimental settings and comparable with that of general physicians in real world settings. Welcome to report any problems (whria78@gmail.com).

# Model Dermatology API Example

<pre><code>python3 modelderm.py
</code></pre>

Use a POST method to transfer up to 5 images and metadata. Please check the python example (python 2 or python 3). 

# Metadata
If you dont have a meta data, please use as following,

<pre><code>
args2_="<id>your_id</id><race></race><birth></birth><sex></sex><location></location><pruritus></pruritus><pain></pain><onset></onset>"
</code></pre>

# Terms of Use
1) Free for non-commecial and research purpose. For commercial purpose, please email whria78@gmail.com
2) Please do not submit images without permission of the original owner. 
3) All submitted images and metadata will be stored as a database. The images will be used solely for the training purpose of the algorithm. 
4) The algorithm has been verified in several retrospective and prospective studies, but please be sure that the algorithm is not certified by FDA or CE, yet. We are preparing for the regulations.
5) We are not responsible for inaccurate diagnosis or technical problems (server down). Failover server will be available soon.

# Authorization (API Key)
At this moment, no authorization required. Please register at http://bbs.modelderm.com . We will notify the policy.

# Web-DEMO
The realtime DEMO is available at http://modelderm.com. 

# Algorithm
The algorithm has been developed and maintained by Han Seung Seog (I Dermatology).
